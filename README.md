# ðŸŽ¥ Movie Recommender System

A **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** built with **Python, NLP, and Streamlit**.  
This system suggests movies similar to the one you select, based on their **tags** (overview, genre, keywords, cast, crew).  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- âœ… Recommends **Top 5 Similar Movies** to the selected one  
- âœ… Uses **CountVectorizer + Cosine Similarity** for recommendations  
- âœ… Interactive **Streamlit Web App**  
- âœ… Clean and Simple UI  
- âœ… Deployable on **Streamlit Cloud**  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas / NumPy**
- **scikit-learn** (CountVectorizer, Cosine Similarity)
- **Streamlit** (for UI)
- **Requests** (for fetching posters from TMDB API)

## ðŸ”¹ Dataset
The dataset used in this project is included as [Dataset.zip](https://github.com/nilotpaldhar2004/movie-recommender-system/raw/main/Dataset.zip).  
It contains details like **genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview** of movies.  

> **Before running the project**, make sure to extract the contents of `Dataset.zip`.  
> The extracted folder includes files like:
> - `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`  
> - `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works
1. **Movie Input:** User selects or searches for a movie.  
2. **Feature Extraction:** App combines overview, genres, keywords, cast, crew to create a tag vector.  
3. **Similarity Calculation:** Computes cosine similarity between the selected movie and all others.  
4. **Top Recommendations:** App fetches top 5 most similar movies, including poster, rating, and release year.  
5. **Display:** Streamlit shows movies with hover effects, ratings in stars, and release year.
